        question: "How does the billing cycle work?",
        answer:
          "Our billing cycle starts on the day you subscribe. You'll be billed monthly or annually, depending on your chosen plan. You can change or cancel your subscription at any time, and it will remain active until the end of your current billing period.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I change my plan later?",
        answer:
          "Yes! You can upgrade or downgrade your plan at any time. When upgrading, you'll pay immediately for the new plan and gain access to the new features right away, and we'll prorate your billing. When downgrading, the change will take effect at the start of your next billing cycle.",
      },
      {
        question: "What payment methods does the platform accept?",

    questions: [
      {
        question: "What happens when I reach my monthly token limit?",
        answer:
          "When you reach your monthly token limit, you'll be notified. You can either wait for your tokens to reset at the start of your next billing cycle, or upgrade to a higher plan for immediate access to more tokens.",
      },
      {
        question: "Do unused tokens roll over to the next month?",
        answer:
          "Yes, unused tokens will roll over to the next month. This allows you to save tokens for future use.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I track my token usage?",
        answer:

      {
        question: "How do I cancel my subscription?",
        answer:
          "You can cancel your subscription at any time from your account settings. Your access will continue until the end of your current billing period. We don't offer refunds for partial months of service.",
      },
      {
        question: "What happens to my data if I cancel?",
        answer:
          "Your data remains secure and accessible for 30 days after cancellation. After this period, it will be automatically deleted from our systems. We recommend exporting any important data before cancelling.",
