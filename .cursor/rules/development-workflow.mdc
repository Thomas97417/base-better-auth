# Development Workflow

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start development server: `npm run dev`
3. Run database migrations: `npx prisma migrate dev`

## Development Process
- Create feature branches from `main`
- Follow conventional commits
- Update documentation as needed
- Write tests for new features

## Environment Setup
- Use `.env` for environment variables
- Never commit sensitive data
- Use Docker for consistent development environments

## Testing
- Write unit tests for utilities
- Create component tests for UI
- Test server actions independently
- Run tests before committing

## Deployment
- Verify builds locally before pushing
- Use staging environment for testing
- Follow the deployment checklist
- Monitor logs after deployment

## Code Review
- Review PR descriptions
- Check for TypeScript errors
- Verify test coverage
- Ensure documentation is updated
